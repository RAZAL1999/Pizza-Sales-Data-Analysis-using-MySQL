Pizza Sales Data Analysis with MySQL
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data to uncover key business insights. Utilizing MySQL Workbench, I performed various SQL queries to understand customer behavior, popular products, and revenue trends, providing actionable intelligence for business decision-making.

Domain
Data Analysis and Business Intelligence in the Food & Beverage industry.

Key Features & Analysis
Identified the most common pizza order quantities.

Determined the highest-priced pizza.

Analyzed the most frequently ordered pizza sizes.

Identified top 5 pizza types by quantity.

Calculated total quantity ordered per pizza category.

Explored category-wise distribution of pizza types.

Determined top 3 pizza types based on revenue.

Calculated total revenue and percentage share by pizza category.

Technologies Used
MySQL Workbench: For database management and SQL querying.

SQL: For data extraction, transformation, and analysis.

Project Structure (Files to Upload)
To set up this project, you would typically upload the following:

pizza_sales_schema.sql (or similar):

This file should contain the SQL script to create the database schema (tables like orders, order_details, pizzas, pizza_types) and populate them with sample data. This is crucial for anyone to replicate your environment.

If you don't have this, you'll need to create it based on your database structure.

pizza_sales_queries.sql (or similar):

This file will contain all the SQL queries you wrote and executed in MySQL Workbench for your analysis. You can copy-paste them directly from your SQL files (e.g., SQL File 4, SQL File 5, etc., as seen in your screenshots).

Organize them with comments (--) explaining what each query does, similar to how you had them in your PDF.

README.md: (This file itself)

Provides an overview of your project.

screenshots/ (Optional Directory):

You can create a folder named screenshots/ and include the images you provided (or similar ones) showing your MySQL Workbench interface with queries and results. This visually demonstrates your work.

For example: screenshots/query_most_common_size.jpg, screenshots/query_revenue_by_category.jpg.

How to Use/Run
Set up MySQL: Ensure you have MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench installed.

Create Database & Tables: Execute the pizza_sales_schema.sql script in MySQL Workbench to create the database and tables.

Run Analysis Queries: Open pizza_sales_queries.sql in MySQL Workbench and execute the queries to reproduce the analysis.
